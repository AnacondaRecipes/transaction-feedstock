  summary: 'Transaction management for Python'
  description: |
    A transaction consists of one or more operations that we want to perform
    as a single action. It's an all or nothing proposition: either all the
    operations that are part of the transaction are completed successfully or
    none of them have any effect. In the transaction package, a transaction
    object represents a running transaction that can be committed or aborted
    in the end.
